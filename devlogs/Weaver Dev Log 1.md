- Creating a game engine from scratch to learn how they work
- Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Desired Features:
	- [Entity Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) (ECS) architecture
		- Inspired by [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
	- 3D Renderer written from scratch using math and a framebuffer
	- Editor interface (a la Unity, Unreal, Godot)
		- *Not* a library or framework like Bevy!
- Different video format / upload schedule
	- Start uploading videos earlier in the development process
	- Get something working -> upload video about it
	- Going to try to manage my time better so I don't burn out
- What I have so far
	- Very basic ECS supporting static, hardcoded Systems and both immutable and mutable queries
	- Crates I'm using:
		- [Winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)
		- [Pixels](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels)
		- [Raqote](https://github.com/jrmuizel/raqote)
	- Nothing is really how it needs to be, but it's a start!
