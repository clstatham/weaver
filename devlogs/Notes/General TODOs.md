- Stateful Systems and Queries
	- Init once, reuse/update stateful resources between runs
- Make renderer make more sense
	- Refactor DrawFns, RenderCommands, batching
	- Don't assume every camera wants to render the whole scene
- weaver-task: Task pools and thread managers (a la Bevy)
- Better error handling with `thiserror` and less reliance on `anyhow`
	- Panic and unwrap less
