- Demo
- Big architectural changes
	- Separate functionality into modular crates
	- Common `Plugin` interface allows modules to add functionality
- ECS rewrite ... again
	- Fabricate (ECS from last video) was way too complicated and messy
		- Trying to do too many things at once (ECS, scene hierarchies, reflection, scripting...)
	- Keeping it simple for now
		- Just does ECS and scene hierarchies currently
		- Worrying about scripting etc later
- `weaver-asset` crate
	- Introduced concept of `Asset`s and `Handle`s
		- Assets are world-scope like Resources (in fact they're stored in one), but you can have multiple of the same type
		- Handles allow Entities to have Assets as Components
- Renderer rewrite
	- Render Graph
	- Traits/Plugins for managing GPU components
		- GPU components are just regular ECS components now
		- Also have GPU versions of Resources and Assets
- What's next?
	- Continue reimplementing renderer features
		- Shadows, HDR, skyboxes/IBL
	- Eventually get started on scripting
