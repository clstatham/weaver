- Started on basic 3d software renderer
	- Only does solid lines for now
	- Supports 3d coordinates and transforms using matrices
- How does rasterization work in a simple case like this?
	- Need 3 things:
		- A framebuffer to render pixels to
		- A virtual 3d world with objects in it
			- Translation, rotation, scale information
		- A virtual camera with view and projection transforms
	- The 3d world is represented in the form of Entities and Components
		- Building on the last video's topic!
	- In `render()`:
		- Query the ECS world for vertex and transform components
		- Apply the transforms to the vertices
		- Apply the camera's view and projection matrices to get screen-space coordinates
		- Draw lines using the screen-space coordinates
- Limitations of my current implementation
	- Obviously, it can only do solid lines
		- Filled shapes and shading hopefully coming soon!
	- No support for index lists / proper meshes
		- It's like writing in cursive: each line is connected to the previous one
	- Very hacky, code needs to be cleaner
	- It's probably slow as heck
		- TODO: Add frame-time / fps counter
