- Man, it's been a while!
	- The entire old version of the engine has been scrapped
	- I've been hyper-focusing on the rewrite
		- Sorry for not making videos!
- Philosophy changes
	- GPU graphics are just way more practical
		- Save myself the headache of optimizing a software renderer
	- Static `System`s powered by procedural macros
		- Hopefully, eventually, we can have runtime-defined systems too!
- So, what's new?
	- Overhauled renderer using `wgpu`
	- Overhauled ECS using proc macros
	- Added `egui` integration
- Tour of the renderer
	- Uses a sort of pseudo-deferred architecture
		- `Pass`: composable plug-and-play render passes
	- Existing passes:
		- PBR pass
		- Shadow pass
		- HDR decoding pass
		- Skybox pass
		- Doodad pass
- Tour of the ECS:
	- Custom derive macros for Component, Bundle, and Resource
	- Custom attribute macro for Systems
	- Query filter system inspired by Bevy
- What's next?
	- OPTIMIZE, OPTIMIZE, OPTIMIZE
